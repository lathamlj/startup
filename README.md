# simon-html

This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements for structure, basic formatting, input, output, links, and drawing.

I made many changes to the simon-html files for the development of the html for the keen startup application. I added the bulk of the textual information that will be needed for the application. This includes mainly the instructions and guidelines to follow for users. I added an image that will need to be properly sized as well as input boxes where users will enter their daily observations. I kept good portions of the simon-html that I will also be implementing into the keen app such as a login input, a stored data section, as well as the implementation of a daily inspirational quote.
