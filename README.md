## Elevator Pitch:

Introducing the Keen app—a tool to rekindle your powers of observation in today's content-driven world. We often rely on others' insights, losing touch with our ability to truly observe life. Keen empowers you to cultivate this skill.

With Keen, it's easy. Simply post a daily observation on our public forum, from a small act of kindness to a profound societal insight. We believe every observation adds value, nurturing your ability to observe actively. Break free from passive content consumption and embrace the art of keen observation with the Keen app.

##Representation of all Technologies:

### HTML:
Provide the structure of my application. My application will have 3 different pages: “login”, “observations” and “rules and guidelines” pages.

### CSS:
Add a simple yet aesthetic appeal to application. Will probably choose a darker color scheme for my page layout.

### JavaScript:
Provide the functionality of the actual posting of the observations by users. If I have time to figure out how users can like each other's posts or even comment on each other's posts that would be accomplished through Javascript.

### Calling Web Services:
I will call web services by cycling through a server that has a database of insightful quotes or even images of pretty landscapes to make the application more thought-provoking.

### Providing Web Services:
I will provide web services by allowing users of the Keen app to be able to read each other's daily observations from within the app.

### Authentication:
I will create a login page on the web application to prompt users to sign in with an email and password.

### Storing Data Persistently:
I will store data persistently through my web application by perhaps automatically saving users’ posts. I think I will want to delete these after a certain amount of time so that I don’t have too much data build up over time because I don’t know how to get my web application robust enough to be able to store much data. Perhaps after a week the users’ posts automatically delete.

### Web Sockets:
I will accomplish this task by immediately informing live users when other users are also on the application. Another possibility would be just to show the users each others’ posts.
